## 👩‍💻 About Me

I’m an aspiring data engineer passionate about building data pipelines, developing ETL/ELT processes, and turning raw data into analytics-ready models.  
I enjoy designing workflows that are testable, observable, and easy to reason about, and I’m gradually moving from SQL-only projects into modern orchestration and cloud warehousing.

My current learning is focused on:
- 🐍 Python for data engineering, automation, and data validation (pandas and scripts)
- 🗄️ Data modeling and warehousing (medallion-style layers, star-schema style marts)
- ☁️ Cloud data platforms, especially Google BigQuery
- 🔄 Orchestration with Dagster and containerized workflows (Docker)
- 📊 Visualization and reporting with Power BI
